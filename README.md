# baseball_names

What's in a name? And could it have any impact on who you become? That's a question people have probably asked before, including a guy named Michael, who wondered if players with different types of names perfomed any better (or worse) than their colleagues

## Thesis

This is a bit of a work in progress still.

## Data

Before we can compare player performance, we first have to know how they performed. Due to it's play-by-play nature, Baseball has a rich history of data to pull from that can be used to measure a players performance. Tracking of some play types has only begun recently such as differentiating the difference between an intentional and unintenional walk. Rule changes and expansion teams may also have a small impact on how the modern game is played, but todays game is largely the same as it always has.
